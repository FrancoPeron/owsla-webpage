        description: "2021 marks the 10-year anniversary of What So Not. For Chris Emerson, the creative at the heart of the project, it is a time of realization and research, rethinking and renewal. It would be easy for the Australian producer and DJ to stay sequestered in What So Not’s significant accomplishments, not the least of which are surpassing one billion global streams and collecting Gold Plaques. Instead, Emerson scaled back his touring to get re-centered as a person and refreshed as an artist. He immersed himself in an artist community, absorbing a variety of creative stimuli and exploring new ways of expressing himself. The first decade of What So Not revolved around high-profile collaborations, headlining tours and major festivals across the globe, not to mention creative artistic achievements. The second decade of What So Not starts with reflection and revitalization, and new innovations from the ever-shifting Emerson.",

        description: 'Vindata is an electronic project by Branden Ratcliff. Formerly a duo with Jared Poythress, the project started out producing Hip-Hop and R&B before infiltrating the electronic dance scene in the early 2010s. With a distinct style that reflected R&B roots and gospel upbringing, Vindata quickly made its mark as a forward-thinking tastemaker. At the height of the EDM boom, Vindata injected a breath of fresh air into the scene. "For One to Follow," the second EP released in 2014, attracted the attention of several heavy-weight DJs. It led to remixes for Ellie Goulding, DJ Mustard, A-Trak, Jack Ü, and more. Vindata signed to Skrillex´s OWSLA label in 2015, releasing the third EP, "Through Time and Space...," and continued to gain recognition over the next two years, dropping singles like "Own Life" (ft. Anderson .Paak) and "Right Now" (ft. Njomza and Alex & Alex). The project also solidified its place in the Hip-Hop world by collaborating with Fat Joe, Remy Ma & The Dream on the 2017 single "Heartbreak". Vindata made its highly-anticipated return in 2021 with a debut album titled "...With Opened Eyes," on Monstercat.',
